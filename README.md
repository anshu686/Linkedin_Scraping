# Design of various web crawlers for real world applications. 

This repository contains web data-collection tasks in Python 3.5 that I chose as an exercise in programming for #100DaysofCode challenge. I started this challenge to expose myself to this huge sea of data-mining frameworks in python.

Completed projects till now  :

**1. Desktop notifier for daily news updates. [news.py](https://github.com/anshu686/Web_Scraping/blob/master/news.py)**

**2. Desktop notifier for live cricket scores. (Cricket_score.py)**

**3. Scraped Linkedin profile to fetch useful information. (linkedin.py)**
