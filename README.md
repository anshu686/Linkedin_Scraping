# Design of various web crawlers for real world applications. 

This repository contains web data-collection tasks in Python 3.5 that I chose as an exercise in programming for #100DaysofCode challenge. I started this challenge to expose myself to this huge sea of data-mining frameworks in python.

Completed projects till now  :

**1. Desktop notifier for daily news updates.**

**2. Desktop notifier for live cricket scores.**

**3. Scraped Linkedin profile to fetch useful information.**
